    <h1>HTML Fundamentals</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page.
        <br> It acts as a 'blueprint' to display data on a user's screen. This is the basic building block of
        <br> the web. Every page on the internet is just HTML at its core.
    </p>
    <h2>What are HTML-elements?</h2>
    <p>
        Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be
        <br> displayed.
    </p>
    <h2>What is a tag?</h2>
    <p>
        An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will
        <br>be displayed per the instructions of the element.
    </p>
    <h2>How does the browser use HTML to create what I see?</h2>
    <p>
        The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer intended
        <br>the data to appear on the screen
    </p>
    <h2>What are the basic HTML-elements?</h2>
    <p>
        The elements we learned about were html, head, body, 'p', span, div and h1-h6.
    </p>
    <h2>More elements</h2>
    <h3>A-tag</h3>
    <p>
        The 'a' ("anchor") element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other
        <br>areas within our own web page) . You will always see the 'a' element used with
        <br> the href attribute to tell the browser what address you want the link to point to.

    <h3>Img-tag</h3>
    <p>
        This element will display an image on the screen. It will always have an 'src' attribute which
        <br> points to the adress of the image to be displayed. NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in
        <br>they do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:
